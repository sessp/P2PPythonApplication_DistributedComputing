# P2PPythonApplication_DistributedComputing
A Peer-to-Peer app that allows clients to run Python jobs/scripts made by other clients.

Program is more of a demonstration of my ability in using ASP.NET MVC and a peer to peer application. Program allows clients to run python jobs/code on other clients.
